1. INTRODUCTION 
Music taste is something so personal to an individual, yet music bridges differences and serves as a foundational pillar of culture, uniting people of all different backgrounds. Now– let’s zoom out and look at how music is perceived and evaluated by society on a wide-scale. The patterns and trends not only inform us about society, but about aspects of our fundamental humanity. In our project, we are motivated by the question: __What are the relationships between musical genres, emotional sentiment, the sex of vocalists, and societal reception of popular albums?__ Specifically, we investigate similarities and discrepancies in album ratings by vocalists’ sex, differences in sentiment values for albums by vocalists’ sex and by genre, differences in mean ratings by sentiment value and by genre, and the trend of album ratings over the years. Furthermore, we construct a model with the goal of predicting albums’ ratings from the aforementioned features.
